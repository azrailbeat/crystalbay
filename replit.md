## System Architecture

The application follows a modular, service-oriented architecture, designed for cloud deployment with scalability and fault tolerance.

### Core Components
- **Analytics Dashboard with AI Insights**: Professional analytics dashboard with real-time KPI tracking, Chart.js visualizations, and OpenAI-powered business insights. Tracks financial metrics (revenue, average booking value, profit margins), operational metrics (conversion rate, occupancy, cancellations), and customer metrics (CLV, CAC, repeat rate, NPS).
- **Web Admin Dashboard**: A clean Flask-based interface with an Apple-inspired design and light theme, providing a centralized control panel for all operations.
- **SAMO API Integration**: Comprehensive integration for tour booking, inventory management, and real-time tour data, including a full SAMO API management system with testing capabilities for over 60 commands.
- **Lead Management**: A Kanban-style system for tracking and managing customer leads, integrated with a detailed customer journey mapping feature.
- **Tour Management**: A unified single-page interface for tour search and booking, dynamically populating data from the SAMO API.

### Technical Implementations & Design Choices
- **Frontend**: Utilizes a responsive Bootstrap-based UI for the web admin dashboard, emphasizing a clean and intuitive user experience with an Apple-inspired design.
- **Backend**: Built on Flask, serving both the web dashboard and RESTful API endpoints, handling bot process management and CORS.
- **API Layer**: Implements RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations, lead import, and real-time status updates.
- **AI/NLP**: Incorporates `NLPProcessor` for message understanding, `InquiryProcessor` for automated lead analysis, and `IntelligentChatProcessor` for AI-powered chat automation using OpenAI GPT-4o.
- **Proxy Solutions**: Includes `TinyProxy` client and a PHP/bash script solution for transparent HTTP proxy routing to bypass IP restrictions.
- **Centralized Settings**: A unified panel for managing all integrations and system configurations.
- **Bitrix24 CRM Integration**: Custom travel booking pipeline matching a 9-stage Trello workflow for lead and deal management.
- **Production Readiness**: Designed for production deployment, featuring a health check endpoint, comprehensive preloading of SAMO data, and robust error handling for API unavailability.

## External Dependencies

- **SAMO Travel API**: The primary third-party service for tour booking, inventory management, and real-time tour data.
- **Flask**: The Python web framework used for the backend.
- **Bootstrap 5**: The CSS framework for the frontend UI.
- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database used for data storage.
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: Utilized for AI-powered chat automation and intelligent processing.

## Recent Changes (October 8, 2025):
