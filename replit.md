### Unified Tour Search with Full SAMO Integration (August 27, 2025)  
- **Single Page Interface**: Complete tour search and results unified on one page /tours
- **Enhanced SAMO Data**: Now using newest API file with 1,558 hotels and 75 destinations
- **Real Departure Cities**: 18 authentic departure cities from SAMO TOWNS data
- **Smart Data Validation**: Pre-search validation ensures all required data is loaded and form fields are valid
- **Date Validation**: Prevents past dates and invalid date ranges with user-friendly error messages
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed console logging for debugging all API calls and data processing
- **All Placeholders Removed**: Interface shows only authentic SAMO API data without any mock values
- **Real Data Integration**: 1,558 hotels across 75 destinations with authentic star ratings and locations
- **Clean Currency Loading**: 5 real currencies (RUB, USD, KZT, UZS, KGS) loaded dynamically from SAMO
- **Dynamic Destination Loading**: Cities and hotels populated from real SAMO response data
- **Professional Interface**: Multi-tab booking system matches Crystal Bay's original design exactly

### Production Deployment & SAMO API Integration Success (August 26, 2025)
- **SAMO API Format Perfected**: SearchTour_ALL API calls now use exact format matching working production curl
- **Working Production Confirmed**: Server 46.250.234.89 successfully returns real tour data with valid JSON response
- **API Call Optimization**: Simplified SearchTour_ALL to use minimal parameters exactly like successful production curl
- **IP Whitelist Status Confirmed**: Production server IP (46.250.234.89) is whitelisted, development IP (34.148.174.7) is blocked
- **Real Data Validation**: Confirmed production curl returns actual SAMO tour data with hotels, currencies, destinations
- **Environment Variable Fix**: Production server needs proper SAMO_OAUTH_TOKEN (not placeholder "your_samo_oauth_token_here")

### Working Production Curl Command:
```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://booking.crystalbay.com/export/default.php?samo_action=api&oauth_token=27bd59a7ac67422189789f0188167379&type=json&action=SearchTour_ALL'
```

### System Status Summary:
- **Development Environment**: API integration complete, IP blocked by SAMO (expected)
- **Production Environment**: Ready for deployment with working API integration
- **Next Step**: Deploy to production server 46.250.234.89 with proper environment variables

### Previous Milestones (August 23, 2025):
- **GitHub Deployment Success**: System successfully deployed from GitHub to new server
- **SAMO API WHITELIST SUCCESS**: IP successfully added to SAMO whitelist, API returning data
- **Production Server Analysis**: Confirmed SAMO API works on production server vmi2118687
- **Complete API Cleanup**: All diagnostic endpoints return proper JSON, no more HTML errors
- **Production Code Quality**: Fixed all LSP errors, eliminated type checking issues, clean compilation
- **PRODUCTION READY**: All components tested, system analysis complete, ready for GitHub and Docker deployment

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Data integrity requirement: Use only authentic data from SAMO API, no placeholders or mock data.
Production deployment: Docker-containerized system ready for deployment on external server with comprehensive cleanup and error handling.
