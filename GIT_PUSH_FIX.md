# Git Push Fix - Crystal Bay Travel

## Problem
The push was rejected because the remote repository has commits that aren't in the local repository.

## Current Status
- Local HEAD: `deec504` - "Update project to fix bugs and improve code quality"  
- Remote origin/main: `2f91f82` - "Clean project and prepare for GitHub release"
- Your local has 2 newer commits ahead of origin/main

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Force Push (Recommended for solo development)
```bash
# This will overwrite the remote with your local changes
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### Option 2: Pull and Merge
```bash
# This will merge remote changes with your local changes
git pull origin main
# Resolve any conflicts if they appear
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Pull with Rebase  
```bash
# This will replay your commits on top of remote changes
git pull --rebase origin main
# Resolve any conflicts if they appear  
git push origin main
```

## Current Situation Analysis
Looking at the commit history:
- `deec504` (HEAD) - Latest bug fixes and code quality improvements
- `b3e060d` - Production setup improvements
- `2f91f82` (origin/main) - Previous GitHub release preparation

Your local version has the latest bug fixes that make the project production-ready, so **Option 1 (force push)** is recommended since these are important improvements.

## Recommended Command
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

This will safely update the remote repository with your latest bug-free version.

## What Changed in Your Recent Commits
- Fixed all LSP errors and import issues
- Resolved SSL certificate parsing problems  
- Corrected Docker production configuration
- Created complete requirements.txt
- Made all Python files compile successfully

These are critical fixes that should be in the remote repository.
